      <title>Overview</title>

      <para><application>Kickstart</application> is a <acronym>PHP</acronym>
      executable file ( <emphasis>script</emphasis> ) which extracts JPA, JPS
      and ZIP archives.</para>

      <para>Typically, it's used to extract the backup archives created with
      Akeeba Backup and Akeeba Solo on a new server or when the administrative
      interface of your site is no longer accessible. The actual restoration
      does not take place through Kickstart, though. The restoration script is
      included in the backup archive itself. Kickstart merely extracts the
      archive and lets you run that restoration script. At the end of the
      process Kickstart lets you clean up with one click which removes itself,
      the backup archive and the restoration script.</para>

      <para>Additionally, Kickstart can be used to install PHP CMS and popular
      scripts such as Joomla!, WordPress, Drupal etc. It can also be used to
      extract ZIP archives with numerous or big files that cannot be extracted
      otherwise. Just make sure your ZIP files are using the Deflate
      compression method.</para>

      <para>Kickstart is also localisable, meaning that it can display itself
      in your own language. All you have to do is to upload your language's
      translation INI file in the same directory as Kickstart.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="why-we-need-kickstart">
      <title>Why do we need Kickstart, anyway?</title>

      <para>Even though Akeeba Backup is designed as an effortless way of
      backing up your site, it is only good up to the point of having a backup
      archive. Restoring it is a pretty much different story.</para>

      <para>Without Kickstart you would have to download the file to your PC;
      extract it; upload all the files, via FTP, to you site (with 5000+ files
      per site this is slow); go through the restoration process; remove the
      installation directory.</para>

      <para>Most of this process is the same for every backup restoration. The
      only place where human intervention is truly required is the restoration
      process part. Moreover, transferring thousands of files over FTP is
      intrinsically slower than transferring big archive files. These are the
      problems Kickstart is designed to solve.</para>

      <para>Kickstart extracts the backup JPS, JPS and ZIP archives directly
      on the target server. The only thing you need to perform a restoration
      is Kickstart and the archive file(s). You just need to upload
      kickstart.php and your archive to the server, visit
      <uri>http://www.yourdomain.com/kickstart.php</uri>, select the archive,
      wait, go through the restoration process, click the cleanup button and
      your site is up and running. All unnecessary files –Kickstart itself,
      the backup archive and the restoration script– are removed.</para>

      <para>In case your files and directories ownership and permissions are
      mixed up Kickstart can write files using FTP, SFTP or our Hybrid mode.
      The Hybrid mode solves a problem known as "permissions hell" where
      different files and folders are owned by different users, making it
      impossible to write to all of them either directly or through FTP. In
      this case Kickstart intelligently decides which method to use (direct
      write or FTP) on a file-to-file basis.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="what-kickstart-is-and-what-it-is-not">
      <title>What Kickstart is and what it's not</title>

      <para>Kickstart is an interactive archive extraction script and a
      clean-up tool. It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a site restoration utility
      in itself. Kickstart performs the steps required before and after site
      restoration, whereas the site restoration procedure itself is carried
      out by the restoration script which was put inside your backup archive
      at backup time. To make it crystal clear, here is the flow of a
      Kickstart-powered site restoration procedure:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Uploading files. This is done manually. You upload Kickstart
          and the backup archive (ZIP or JPA format) to the target site's
          root.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Archive extraction</emphasis> . This is
          done by Kickstart. The backup archive is extracted. At this point
          your site is not yet ready to work.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Restoration process. This is done by the restoration script
          which was put in the archive at backup time and is now extracted on
          your server. You are asked some questions, the database data is
          restored and the new site configuration file is written on the disk.
          At this point, your site is pretty much ready to workin most cases.
          The exception is in case you need to manually reconfigure your
          .htaccess file and/or any software installed on your site (e.g.
          Joomla! components, WordPress plugins, Drupal modules and so on)
          which stores absolute paths or URLs in their own
          configuration.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Cleanup of unnecessary files</emphasis>.
          This is done by Kickstart. The backup archive, the installation
          directory and Kickstart itself are no longer needed and therefore
          deleted.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>As you can see, Kickstart is a very generic tool, not strictly
      limited to restoring Akeeba Backup backup archives. In fact it can be
      used to install popular CMS such as Joomla! and WordPress. It even lets
      you download their installation ZIP archives directly from Kickstart
      itself!</para>

      <tip>
        <para>The correct way to see Kickstart is as a generic, interactive,
        web-based archive extraction script which can also clean up after
        itself.</para>

    <section xml:id="getting-kickstart">
      <title>Getting Kickstart</title>

      <para>Kickstart can be downloaded from our site, <uri
      xlink:href="http://www.akeebabackup.com">https://www.akeebabackup.com/download</uri>.
      The ZIP package you download is named
      <filename>kickstart-<replaceable>VERSION</replaceable>-core.zip</filename>
      or
      <filename>kickstart-<replaceable>VERSION</replaceable>-pro.zip</filename>,
      where VERSION is the version number and core/pro define the kind of
      package (Core or Professional) you have downloaded. Each package
      contains kickstart.php itself, as well as all the available translation
      files. You have to extract this archive and upload kickstart.php and any
      translation INI files you may need to your site.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Kickstart IS NOT a Joomla! extension, WordPress plugin or Drupal
        module. You cannot "install" it on any of these CMS through their
        software installation tools. The entire point of Kickstart is being
        able to restore your site without having to install or access a full
        CMS installation.</para>
      </warning>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="requirements">
      <title>Requirements</title>

      <para>Kickstart is a PHP 5.3 application. It will not work with PHP 4.x,
      5.0, 5.1 or 5.2. The full list or required server configuration
      is:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>PHP 5.3.3 or later.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>PHP zlib module installed and enabled. This should be enabled
          by default.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>PHP Safe Mode disabled, or correct directory ownerships, or
          FTP connection parameters must be entered</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The last requirement must be further explained. PHP with Safe Mode
      enabled will refuse to create folders inside another folder which is not
      owned by the same user as the one the web server (Apache) runs under,
      even if the folder is otherwise writable. Kickstart will fail in this
      case. Alternatively, if you supply the FTP connection information,
      Kickstart will try to use FTP to connect to your site and write the
      extracted files.</para>

      <important>
        <para>If you use the FTP mode, Kickstart will require the specified
        temporary directory to be directly writable by PHP (usually, 0777
        permissions help) or it will attempt to create a temporary directory
        of its own. If this procedure fails, Kickstart will notify you that
        the temporary directory is not writable.</para>
      </important>

      <para>Moreover, if you already have a site installed on the target
      server you have to ensure that all folders and files are writable. If
      not, Kickstart will fail and leave your site in a possibly broken
      state.</para>

      <para>Finally, if your server doesn't support base64 decoding (e.g. the
      base64_decode function is disabled) you need an Internet connection.
      Normally, the required jQuery library is fetched from a base64 encoded
      resource inside the kickstart.php file. If the decoding is not possible,
      Kickstart will fall back to loading it from Google's AJAX API Library
      CDN, which requires an Internet connection and access to Google's CDN
      not be restricted by your firewall or Internet security suite.</para>

    <title>Using Kickstart</title>

    <section xml:id="preparing-for-the-extraction">
      <title>Preparing for the extraction</title>

      <para>The first step is to download the latest release of Kickstart. It
      can be always retrieved by visiting <link
      xlink:href="https://www.akeebabackup.com/download.html">https://www.akeebabackup.com/download.html</link>.
      It comes as a ZIP package. <emphasis>Do not</emphasis> try to install it
      in Joomla!, WordPress, Drupal etc. Instead you'll have to unzip it
      first. The extracted files are <filename>kickstart.php</filename> and a
      lot of .ini, .js and .pem files.</para>

      <para>The <filename>kickstart.php</filename> file is required for
      Kickstart's operation and is self-contained, i.e. it doesn't need any
      other files (or Joomla!, or WordPress, or anything else) to be installed
      on your server.</para>

      <para>The INI files are translation files. You only need them if you
      want Kickstart's interface to be translated in your language. You can
      safely delete any INI files which represent languages you do not
      speak.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>Kickstart chooses the language to display based on your
        browser's language settings, based on the ordering you've set up in
        your browser, choosing the first language on that list that is
        available as a translation INI file. Please consult your browser's
        documentation for information on how to change the language list and
        preferred language order.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>The JS files are not required, unless you don't have an Internet
      connection (e.g. restoring to a local server without an Internet
      connection) or have trouble accessing the sites where copies of these
      files are stored in (e.g. behind a corporate or state firewall). The
      <filename>cacert.pem</filename> file is required on some servers if
      importing from an HTTPS URL. If unsure, upload all files (see
      below).</para>

      <para>The second step is uploading those files to your server. Upload
      <filename>kickstart.php</filename> and any files you may need to the
      server path you want the restored site to be installed. If you want the
      site to be extracted to your domain's root (something like
      <uri>http://www.example.com</uri>) you'll have to locate your web root.
      On most servers it appears as a directory named
      <filename>public_html</filename>, <filename>httpdocs</filename>,
      <filename>htdocs</filename>, <filename>www</filename> or something
      similar when you connect to your account by FTP. If unsure, ask your
      host. They know which directory it is without having to guess.</para>

      <important>
        <para>If you are using Kickstart Professional you MUST rename
        kickstart.php to something that does not include the word "kickstart",
        e.g. wfklgjhwelkurgh.php. Kickstart will refuse to operate otherwise.
        This is a security precaution which cannot be circumvented.</para>
      </important>

      <para>The third step is getting your archive file to the server. This
      can be currently performed only by having you manually upload the
      archive by FTP to the same directory as the one
      <filename>kickstart.php</filename> is in.</para>

      <para>Two words of caution:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Always, no matter what, use the Binary transfer mode to upload
          your backup archives by FTP. If you are using FileZilla you can do
          so by clicking on the Transfer menu, then the Transfer Type submenu
          and making sure that Binary is selected. If you do not do that, most
          FTP software will fall back to ASCII file transfers which will
          corrupt the backup archive and cause extraction issues.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you had created a multi-part archive you have to transfer
          all files. In the case of a JPA file they have the same name and
          extensions of .jpa, .j01, .j02 etc. In the case of a ZIP file they
          have the same name and extensions of .zip, .z01, .z02 etc. If any of
          the parts is missing, an extraction error will occur.</para>

          <para>Do note that the installer is included in the beginning of the
          archive. Even in the event of a partial restoration you will most
          likely be able to start the restoration procedure but your site
          <emphasis>will not work properly</emphasis> as many crucial files
          will be missing!</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>When you are done, you can launch Kickstart by visiting its URL.
      It usually has the form of
      <uri>http://www.example.com/kickstart.php</uri>.</para>

        <para>Once you launch Kickstart, you'll first get a standard notice
        regarding the top things that you should be aware about:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Kickstart is not an installer. It is an archive extraction
            tool. The actual installer was put inside the archive file at
            backup time.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Kickstart is not the only way to extract the backup archive.
            You can use Akeeba eXtract Wizard and upload the extracted files
            using FTP instead.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Kickstart is bound by your server's configuration. As such,
            it may not work at all.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>You should download and upload your archive files using FTP
            in Binary transfer mode. Any other method could lead to a corrupt
            backup archive and restoration failure.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Post-restoration site load errors are usually caused by
            .htaccess or php.ini directives. You should understand that blank
            pages, 404 and 500 errors can usually be worked around by editing
            the aforementioned files. It is not our job to mess with your
            configuration files, because this could be dangerous for your

        </screenshot>

        <para>The setup page contains of four steps.</para>

        <para>The first step is selecting a backup archive. Kickstart
        automatically scans the directory it's in for JPA and ZIP archives,
        populating the drop-down list with these results. If there are
        multiple archives present, please click on the drop down list and
        select the one you would like to use.</para>

        <para>If you want to import a backup archive stored in external
        storage such as Amazon S3, Dropbox etc please consult <link
        linkend="import-external">Importing archives from Amazon S3, Dropbox
        etc</link>.</para>

        <para>The second step is the selection of the extraction method. There
        are two supported methods:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Directly</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>With this method, Kickstart will try to write directly to
              files. This is the ideal method if your server is using suPHP or
              if you have no Joomla! site installed yet. Since Kickstart runs
              in PHP, which in turn might run with your web server's
              privileges, you have to ensure that there are adequate
              permissions to write to the directory Kickstart is in and any
              existing files and directories with the same name as files and
              directories in the archive. If you are not sure, first try to
              remove everything except <filename>kickstart.php</filename> and
              the backup archive from your server. If you still get errors
              regarding the inability to write to files, you'll have to use
              the FTP mode.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Use FTP</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>In this mode, Kickstart tries to extract the files in a
              temporary directory, then use FTP to "upload" them to their
              final location. The ability to run Kickstart in this mode
              depends on your server setup. For example, some servers have a
              very strange firewall setup which doesn't allow Kickstart to
              connect to your site's FTP. Also note that Kickstart support FTP
              and FTPS (FTP over implicit SSL). It does not support the SFTP
              protocol, widely known as Secure FTP or FTP over SSH, as it is
              an entirely different protocol with very poor PHP support on
              commercial hosts.</para>

              <para>The only implication in using the FTP mode is that you
              need a writable temporary directory. More on that later.</para>

              <para>When you choose this option, a list of several options
              will expand underneath it. You have to fill them in for

                <para>Kickstart 3.1 or later, when extracting any ZIP archive
                or JPA archives created by Akeeba Backup 3.1 (or later), will
                also try to restore the last file modification time to match
                that of the source server. If you activate the FTP mode this
                will not be possible, as FTP does not support "touching"
                (changing the modification date and time) of files.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>This mode combines the previous two in an intelligent
              manner. When selected, Kickstart will first attempt to write to
              the files directly. If this is not possible, i.e. due to
              permissions or ownership of the file or folder being exracted,
              it will automatically make use of the FTP mode to overcome the
              permissions / ownership problem. It effectively works around a
              situation commonly called "permissions hell", where different
              files and folders are owned by different users, making it
              extremely difficult to overwrite them. This is a situation which
              happens very commonly on shared hosting. Therefore <emphasis
              role="bold">we strongly advise clients on shared hosting
              environments to use the Hybrid option</emphasis>.</para>

        </variablelist>

        <para>Moreover, there is also the <guilabel>Ignore most
        errors</guilabel> checkbox. When it's checked, Kickstart will not
        throw an error when a file is not writeable. This is useful when you
        are restoring a backup taken on a Linux server to a Windows server. In
        that case, some filenames may contain characters which are valid in
        Linux (e.g. colons) but not on Windows. Checking that option will tell
        Kickstart to ignore file creation errors.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>When that option is enabled, Kickstart will not warn you even
          if a file could not be overwritten because, for example, its
          permissions made it unwriteable. Use with extreme caution and always
          check that all of your files have been extracted properly.</para>

            <term>Temporary Directory</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>As PHP can't directly upload files while they are being
              extracted, Kickstart is extracting them to a temporary directory
              using direct file writes first, then uploads them to their final
              destination using FTP. Normally, Kickstart will try using the
              directory it's stored in to extract the temporary files. Many
              web hosts configure their servers in such a way that this is not
              possible. Using this option you can customise the location of
              the temporary directory to somewhere with adequate permissions.
              You can use either an absolute or a relative (to Kickstart's
              directory) path for this setting.</para>

              <para>If unsure, you can follow an easy workaround. Create a
              directory named <filename>kicktemp</filename> in your site's
              root using FTP and give it 0777 permissions (or world-write
              privileges, e.g. full control to the Everybody pseudo-user, if
              you are using a Windows server). Then type in
              <filename>kicktemp</filename> as this option.</para>

              <tip>
                <para>If you leave this field empty Kickstart will try
                creating the <filename>kicktemp</filename> directory
                automatically. On most servers this works just fine.</para>
              </tip>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        <para>The third step is the Fine-Tuning of the extraction engine. By
        default these advanced options are hidden. Please click the
        <guibutton>Show advanced options (for experts)</guibutton> button to
        display the options.</para>

        <para>The first two options require you to understand how Kickstart
        works. Kickstart will start extracting files until the
        <guilabel>Maximum execution time</guilabel> threshold is reached. In
        fact, Kickstart allows for a 20% uncertainty of the accuracy of the
        elapsed time measurements, so the real duration may be somewhat less
        than that. If there are more files to extract, it will continue
        extraction in the next step. This approach allows it to work around
        the PHP time limit imposed by all hosts. However, if a step takes too
        little time, it is possible that your host mistakenly identifies this
        behaviour as a Denial of Service attack. As a result, Kickstart will
        force each step to last at least as much as the <guilabel>Minimum
        execution time</guilabel> value is. These two settings are expressed
        in seconds and can be perceived as a combined "from-to" step duration
        setting.</para>

        <para>Next, you will find the options for the Stealth Mode in the Fine
        Tuning pane. The Stealth Mode allows you to display a static HTML page
        (optionally with images and SWF animation) to all visitors to the web
        site except yourself while you perform the restoration and only works
        with Apache or any other server supports mod_redirect functionality
        using .htaccess files (even some versions of IIS with third party
        add-ons do). This will prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive
        information while the restoration is in progress. This is performed by
        directing all traffic not coming from your IP address to the page you
        define in here. The first, obvious, setting is the <guilabel>Stealth
        mode</guilabel> check box. When you tick it, the stealth mode will be
        activated. The <guilabel>HTML file to show to web visitors</guilabel>
        option allows you to define the name of the static HTML page to show
        to your visitors. The file and its resources (images, CSS, Javascript
        files) must reside inside your to-be-restored site's root. You must
        only define the name of the file to use, not its URL. This means that
        <filename>offline.html</filename> is a valid setting, whereas
        <uri>http://www.example.com/offline.html</uri> is INVALID and will
        result in a 404 error thrown to your visitors.</para>

        <tip>
          <para>If you are worried about SEO, fear not. The redirection
          happens with a "temporary redirection" HTTP status code, which will
          instruct search engines to revisit your site in a later time. As a
          result, you are not penalized for duplicate content or otherwise
          negatively affect your SEO while restoring your site.</para>
        </tip>

        <para>Finally, we have the <guilabel>Rename server configuration
        files</guilabel> checkbox. By default, Kickstart will rename .htaccess
        to htaccess.bak, web.config to web.config.bak, php.ini to php.ini.bak
        and .user.ini to user.ini.bak before extracting the archive. Moreover,
        any files by that name in the archive will be renamed. When you click
        on the Clean Up button the files are renamed back to their original
        names. These are all files that take an immediate effect on the server
        and can possibly cause the restoration to fail. For example, a
        .htaccess file which prohibits execution of kickstart.php would cause
        the extraction to fail immediately. Unchecking this box will NOT
        rename these files back after extraction. To make it clear, let's take
        the .htaccess file as an example:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>If this box is checked (default) the .htaccess file which
            was contained in the archive IS renamed to htaccess.bak as soon as
            it's extracted. After the restoration is complete, the
            htaccess.bak files IS renamed back to .htaccess</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>If this box is NOT checked the .htaccess file which was
            contained in the archive IS renamed to htaccess.bak as soon as
            it's extracted. After the restoration is complete, the
            htaccess.bak files IS NOT renamed back to .htaccess. Its name
            remains htaccess.bak and you have to manually rename the file,
            e.g. through FTP or your hosting control panel's file
            manager.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <warning>
          <para>Unchecking <guilabel>Rename server configuration
          files</guilabel> will most likely result in the restored site NOT
          working properly, or at all, until you manually rename and possibly
          edit the htaccess.bak, web.config.bak, php.ini.bak and user.ini.bak
          files.</para>

        will launch the <uri>installation/index.php</uri> relative URL to a

        Backup, this will execute the restoration script which was included in
        your backup archive and just got extracted. You will not be running
        Kickstart at that point, so you have to refer to the Akeeba Backup

          backup archive. This means that if you have a backup archive
          weighing 100Mb, you need another 150-200Mb to extract it. In total,
          you'd need 250-300Mb of free disk space before you begin uploading
          files and extracting the archive with Kickstart.</para>

          <important>
            <para>Some hosts claim "unlimited" disk space. Sadly, this is not
            always the case. Most hosts have "hidden" limits, such as the
            amount of files you can host under one account. If you go over
            that limit, you'll get extraction errors. Another thing is that
            you "unlimited" host is physically bound to the size of their hard
            drives. If their hard drive was close to completely filling up,
            trying to extract your site will also lead to a restoration
            failure. If nothing else helps with this kind of errors, do
            contact your host and ask them if you are hitting a file count
            limitation or their hard drive is full.</para>
          </important>

          <para>Moreover, some hosts have a limitation on the maximum file
          size PHP can create. For example, Strato allows PHP to create files
          of only up to 10Mb. Trying to extract bigger files from the archive
          will lead to such an error. Do note that you might be able to upload
          large files, such as your site's backup archive, through FTP.
          However, if you try to extract a large file from the archive (e.g. a
          large non-split database dump, a large video or music file, etc) it
          will fail. Your ONLY way to perform the restoration is to extract
          the archive on your local PC, e.g. using Akeeba eXtract, and
          uploading all the extracted files by FTP. All you'll have to do next
          is visiting the restoration URL which is in the form of
          <uri>http://www.yoursite.com/installation/index.php</uri>. Please
          refer to Akeeba Backup's documentation (the chapter on restoring
          your site) for more information.</para>

          <para>Finally, it may be a classic case of wrong or mixed file and
          directory permissions (a "permissions hell" situation). This is very
          easy to happen if you are restoring to a host with an existing
          installation of Joomla! which doesn't use suPHP, i.e. the majority
          of hosts. You might want to try using the FTP mode. If this still
          doesn't work for you, try removing all existing files and
          directories from your server before restoring the backup archive.
          It's very easy to mix up ownerships and permissions on a shared
          host, effectively entering into a "permissions hell" which is
          virtually impossible to work around unless you have root privileges
          on an SSH console or, more easily, removing all files from the
          account. Do note that removing files might require using both an FTP
          program and your host's control panel, or raising a ticket with your
          host.</para>

    <title>Advanced features</title>

    <section xml:id="import-url">
      <title>Import from a URL and quickly install a fresh copy of Joomla! or
      WordPress</title>

      <tip>
        <para>You can use this feature to <link
        linkend="import-external">import from Amazon S3, Dropbox and other
        remote storage providers</link>.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>This feature allows you to import archives stored in any other
      web-accessible server. Please note that the file must be downloadable
      through the web without authentication, i.e. without needing to log in
      or provide a username, password or other means of authentication. Backup
      archives in the default backup directory of Akeeba Backup are, by
      default,<emphasis role="bold"> NOT</emphasis> web accessible for
      security reasons.</para>

      <para>This way you don't have to go through the extremely time-consuming
      steps of downloading files to your local PC and uploading them back to
      your new site, allowing for much faster site transfers between servers
      and/or site cloning. All you have to do is to use Akeeba Backup (Core or
      Professional) to backup your site, move the backup archive to a
      web-accessible location (e.g. your site's root), then use Akeeba
      Kickstart to restore the backup into any server, very easily.</para>

      <para>Moreover, this feature can be used to quickly install the latest
      version of Joomla! or WordPress. Thanks to a special button (more below)
      it can automatically connect to the Joomla!/WordPress official site,
      find out what is the latest version is and put its URL in the download
      URL box. Since Joomla! and WordPress installation packages use the same
      format and directory structure as Akeeba Backup ZIP archives Kickstart
      can "restore" them, allowing you to quickly install a fresh Joomla! site
      on any server, without time consuming downloads and uploads.</para>

      <important>
        <para>You ABSOLUTELY DO NOT need to install Joomla!, WordPress etc
        before restoring a backup archive generated by Akeeba Backup. In fact,
        you are strongly advised to NOT install your script/CMS AT ALL before
        restoring a backup archive generated by Akeeba Backup. Full site
        backups are restored best on an EMPTY hosting account.</para>
      </important>

      <para>In order to use this feature, upload Akeeba Kickstart into the
      root of the site where you want to restore your backup / install Joomla!
      / install WordPress and run it. Right under Step 1 you will see a small
      blue button reading <guibutton>Import from URL</guibutton>. Click on it.
      The following page appears:</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>

      <para>If you are importing a backup archive from a web server enter its
      URL in the <guilabel>URL to Import</guilabel> field, then click on the
      <guibutton>Import from URL</guibutton> button.</para>

      <important>
        <para>If it is a multipart backup archive, i.e. a backup which
        consists of several files, you will need to repeat this for every
        archive part file.</para>
      </important>

      <para>If you want to install a brand new copy of
      <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> on your site first click on the
      <guilabel>Latest Joomla! Release</guilabel> button. Kickstart will
      connect to joomla.org, find the download URL of the latest version of
      Joomla! and fill in the <guilabel>URL to Import</guilabel> field
      automatically. This will take somewhere between 3 and 10 seconds. Once
      the <guilabel>URL to Import</guilabel> field is filled in just click on
      the <guibutton>Import from URL</guibutton> button. Likewise you can use
      the <guilabel>Latest WordPress Release</guilabel> to have Akeeba
      Kickstart put the URL of the latest WordPress release's ZIP file in the
      field. Please note that the URL of the English version of the WordPress
      ZIP package will be put in the field. If you want a different language
      you need to go to WordPress.org and copy the URL to the localised
      WordPress package yourself.</para>

      <screenshot>
        <info>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>

      <para>The download of the file begins. Depending on the capabilities of
      the server hosting your backup archive you will see a progress bar. If
      the remote server doesn't report the size of the backup archive, you
      will simply see the text below the empty bar indicating how much of the
      backup archive has already been imported.</para>

      <para>Once the import is complete you'll be presented with the final
      page of the importer:</para>

      <screenshot>
        <info>
          <title>Finished importing from URL</title>
        </info>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>

      <para>Click on the <guibutton>Reload Kickstart</guibutton> button to
      reload Kickstart and have it list your newly imported file.
      Congratulations! You are now ready to restore the backup archive you
      just imported / install Joomla!.</para>

      <title>Importing archives from Amazon S3, Dropbox, etc</title>

      <para>The Import from URL feature can be used to import backup archives

    distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
    not allowed.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">0. PREAMBLE</bridgehead>

    <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
    everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
    without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
    this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit
    for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications
    made by others.</para>

    <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
    designed for free software.</para>

    <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
    free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can
    be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it
    is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
    works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</bridgehead>

    <para>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
    that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
    under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any
    such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
    addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or
    distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
    law.</para>

    <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications
    and/or translated into another language.</para>

    <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
    of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook
    of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The
    relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject
    or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical
    or political position regarding them.</para>

    <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
    says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does
    not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
    designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.
    If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
    none.</para>

    <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
    that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</para>

    <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
    public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
    generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
    programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
    variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in
    an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup,
    has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
    readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for
    any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
    "Opaque".</para>

    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
    XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
    image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
    formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
    SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
    some word processors for output purposes only.</para>

    <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
    which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near
    the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning
    of the body of the text.</para>

    <para>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
    title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
    text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
    specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
    "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of
    such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
    section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>

    <para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
    which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
    but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
    these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
    meaning of this License.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">2. VERBATIM COPYING</bridgehead>

    <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
    notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
    Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
    measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
    copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
    exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

    <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
    and you may publicly display copies.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</bridgehead>

    <para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
    Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
    cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
    with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
    other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
    the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
    these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
    respects.</para>

    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably)
    on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</para>

    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
    along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
    computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
    access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
    Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
    copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
    year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
    through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
    the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
    give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
    Document.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">4. MODIFICATIONS</bridgehead>

    <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
    Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
    filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
    modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
    addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
        distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
        versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
        section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous
        version if the original publisher of that version gives
        permission.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
        entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
        Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors
        of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than
        five), unless they release you from this requirement.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
        Modified Version, as the publisher.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
        adjacent to the other copyright notices.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
        notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under
        the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum
        below.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
        Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
        notice.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Include an unaltered copy of this License.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
        and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
        and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
        there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
        stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
        given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
        Version as stated in the previous sentence.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
        for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
        the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it
        was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may
        omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
        years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
        version it refers to gives permission.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
        Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
        substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
        dedications given therein.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
        unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
        equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section
        may not be included in the Modified Version.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
        "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
        Section.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</simpara>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of
    these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
    Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles
    must be distinct from any other section titles.</para>

    <para>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
    example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
    an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</para>

    <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and
    a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover
    Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
    made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for
    the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
    entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
    that added the old one.</para>

    <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
    License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert
    or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

    <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released under
    this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list
    them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
    notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</para>

    <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.
    If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
    contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end
    of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of
    that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment
    to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
    notice of the combined work.</para>

    <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
    in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History";
    likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any
    sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled
    "Endorsements".</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

    <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
    documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
    of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
    included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
    License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
    respects.</para>

    <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
    distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy
    of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in
    all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT
    WORKS</bridgehead>

    <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting
    from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
    compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the
    Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
    other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of
    the Document.</para>

    <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
    entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
    bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
    covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear
    on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">8. TRANSLATION</bridgehead>

    <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
    from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or
    all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
    Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all
    the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
    provided that you also include the original English version of this
    License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In
    case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of
    this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
    prevail.</para>

    <para>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
    "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
    Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">9. TERMINATION</bridgehead>

    <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
    except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to
    copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
    have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS
    LICENSE</bridgehead>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
    the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
    will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
    to address new problems or concerns. See <link
    xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</link> .</para>

    <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
    number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of
    this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
    any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
    Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
    by the Free Software Foundation.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your
    documents</bridgehead>

    <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy
    of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
    notices just after the title page:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para>Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME.</para>

      <para>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
      document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version
      1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with
      no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A
      copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
      Documentation License".</para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
    Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
      LIST.</para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
    combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
    situation.</para>

    <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
    recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
    software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their
    use in free software.</para>
