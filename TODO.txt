gh-5 Delete everything before extraction

Make sure the Zapper works but leaves behind the correct files
	First a dry run with a null writer
	Then a real run against a dummy site

If Dry Run is enabled in Kickstart (kickstart.setup.dryrun) DO NOT actually delete anything.
	Look for $postProc in Zapper for the two lines where this is to be implemented

Add a Kickstart engine option to enable this feature
	If enabled run it before extraction
	Improvement: only enable if this is restore.php (KICKSTART is not defined) OR if it's the Pro version of Kickstart

Add a GUI control for it. ONLY FOR THE PRO VERSION.

Add a CLI control for it

Update Akeeba Backup's integrated restoration with a control for it

Update Akeeba Solo's integrated restoration with a control for it
