gh-5 Delete everything before extraction

-- If Dry Run is enabled in Kickstart (kickstart.setup.dryrun) DO NOT actually delete anything.

-- Add a CLI control for kickstart.setup.zapbefore

-- Add a CLI observer for Zapper

-- Make sure the Zapper works but leaves behind the correct files

-- Only enable kickstart.setup.zapbefore if this is restore.php (KICKSTART is not defined) OR if it's the Pro version of Kickstart

-- Add a GUI control for kickstart.setup.zapbefore -- ONLY FOR THE PRO VERSION.
