Kickstart 4.1.2
================================================================================
+ By default hide fine tuning options
+ Better detection of the directory holding the archives and the best choice for a temporary directory
# [MEDIUM] Extracting symlinks in Dry Run mode would cause existing symlinks to be removed
# [LOW] Kickstart won't start on servers with problematic open_basedir restrictions
# [LOW] PHP notices when extracting symlinks
# [LOW] No error message shown when the server throws an error (thanks, Carlos!)
# [LOW] Wrong offset reported when an archive cannot be extracted

Kickstart 4.1.1
================================================================================
~ Reset OPcache after removing the installation directory

Kickstart 4.1.0
================================================================================
+ Kickstart displays a more insightful error message if the archive file cannot be opened for reading.
# [LOW] A .user.ini file in the archive file could get in the way of the extraction. Now it gets the same treatment as php.ini and .htaccess files.
# [LOW] If you have both kickstart.php and a renamed copy (e.g. x.php) and try to access the renamed copy you get a Fatal Error.
# [HIGH] Contrary to what was promised, you could not really extract archives in a directory other than the one Kickstart is in.

Kickstart 4.0.0
================================================================================
+ You can list and extract archives in any directory, not just the one Kickstart is in
+ If you use the default backup output directories, Kickstart will automatically look for archives there if the directory where Kickstart is doesn't contain any archives
# [MEDIUM] Clicking on Browse when you had selected the Hybrid mode would attempt to launch the SFTP directory browser instead of the FTP directory browser
# [MEDIUM] The Port setting in (S)FTP options was ignored

Kickstart 3.9.0
================================================================================
# [HIGH] The Hybrid restoration mode failed to connect to FTP, making it equivalent to using direct file writes every time
# [HIGH] Kickstart throws a Javascript error on Windows
# [HIGH] Importing from a URL doesn't work when the remote web server doesn't support Range headers (e.g. when downloading the latest Joomla! release)
# [LOW] The Hybrid restoration mode wasn't compatible with HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine, an alternative PHP runtime by Facebook)

Kickstart 3.8.1
================================================================================
+ Detect if the restored is Joomla!. If not, do not show the "Visit the site's back-end" button to avoid confusion.
+ Support for installing the latest WordPress release using Kickstart

Kickstart 3.8.0
================================================================================
~ You now get a warning if you specify a valid FTP directory which is not the directory where kickstart.php is stored in, preventing the most common user error
+ Import archives from a URL
+ Download the latest Joomla! release (install Joomla! without downloading / uploading tons of files!)
+ Hybrid restoration engine: writes files directly, uses FTP if direct file write fails
# {PRO} [MEDIUM] Symlinks in JPS (encrypted) archives would not be restored
# [LOW] Trying to extract an archive with a "logs" folder on a Plesk server (which has an unwriteable, system-owned logs folder) led to inability to extract the archive
# [LOW] Undefined variables in various places which somehow never got reported

Kickstart 3.7.1
================================================================================
~ Detect and warn about Internet Explorer 8 or lower

Kickstart 3.7.0
================================================================================
+ Rename web.config to web.config.bak during extraction to prevent issues with IIS
# S3 import was broken

Kickstart 3.6.0
================================================================================
# Multipart S3 import would fail when the part size was less than 1Mb

Kickstart 3.5.3
================================================================================
+ Kickstart will now attempt to salvage as much data as possible from corrupt JPA archives
# Import from S3 would fail on large files

Kickstart 3.5.2
================================================================================
# Error messages from S3 would not show up in the interface, making error resolution impossible
+ Added a cacert.pem file in Kickstart Professional's package, allowing servers lacking a CA certificate cache to connect to Amazon S3

Kickstart 3.5.1
================================================================================
# Could not restore archives with parts over 2Gb long, except when using the native 64-bit Linux PHP version
# The Import from S3 feature was broken

Kickstart 3.5.0
================================================================================
+ #114 Ignore most errors option (May cause partial extraction; use with EXTREME CAUTION!)
+ #118 Import archives from S3
~ The Javascript libraries (jQuery and JSON2) are now only loaded from a CDN and not included in the script

Kickstart 3.4.2
================================================================================
# JPS extraction was unacceptably slow because one request per extracted file was made

Kickstart 3.4.1
================================================================================
# When an error occurred, the link to the troubleshooting page wasn't clickable
# Small layout issues (thank you, @nternetinspired)

Kickstart 3.4.0
================================================================================
~ Massive redesign, courtesy of Internet Inspired

Kickstart 3.3.2
================================================================================
