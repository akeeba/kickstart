<h3>Release highlights</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Informative error message when your PHP version is too old for this version of Kickstart</strong>.
    Previously you would get a straight up failure. Please note that this will still NOT work when yor PHP
    version is older than 5.3.0 due to the way PHP works under the hood.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Print a warning when your PHP version is End of Life</strong>.
    We've found that the primary reason the majority of users are on an end of life PHP version (which no
    longer receives security updates) is ignorance of the fact that it's end of life. We think it's our duty
    and responsibility as developers to notify users so they have a chance to upgrade to a modern, secure
    PHP version.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Changed the documentation URLs following documentation refactoring on our site.</strong>.
</p>

<h3>PHP 5.6 or later is required</h3>
<p>
    Akeeba Kickstart requires PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4. It won't run on hosts running PHP versions 5.5, 5.4, 5.3, 5.2, 5.1, 5.0 or any 4.x versions.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that we <strong>do not</strong> test Kickstart on End of Life versions of PHP. For a
    definition of End of Life (EOL) and a list of EOL PHP versions please consult the official PHP site at
