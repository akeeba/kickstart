<h3>Release highlights</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Support for JPS format v2.0</strong>. Akeeba Backup for Joomla! 5.3 as well as Akeeba Backup for WordPress
    and Akeeba Solo 2.1 and later versions use a newer version of the JPS encrypted archive format. Please use Kickstart
    5.3.0 or later to extract these backup archives.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Option to restore file permissions</strong>. If you are restoring a JPA or JPS backup archive on a Linux,
    macOS, *BSD or other UNIX-based operating system you can now restore the file permissions. WARNING! DANGER! This is
    a BAD IDEA if your original site had mixed ownership of files. Furthermore please note that Windows DOES NOT have a
    concept of file permissions, therefore this feature will do NOTHING AT ALL on Windows. Kindly remember that this is
    how Windows works and there is nothing we can do about it (we are not Microsoft). Thank you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Importing large files from a URL now actually works</strong>. There was a bug with importing large files
    from a URL which caused the download to restart repeatedly and ultimately fail.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Stealth mode .htaccess didn't work as expected</strong>. Fixed thanks to the bug report by invader_11.
</p>
