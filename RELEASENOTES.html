<h3>Release highlights</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Amazon S3 v4 API support</strong>. Kickstart Professional's Import from S3 feature is now using the modern
    Amazon S3 v4 API. This lets you import archives from Amazon S3 regions which only support the v4 API such as
    Frankfurt and Sao Paolo. It also supports S3 regions in China –currently Amazon only offers one in Beijing– which
    work only with the v4 API.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Support for the new Joomla download location</strong>. The Import from URL feature now lets you import the
    latest Joomla version's installation ZIP file. This was broken in all previous Kickstart versions due to changes
    in the way Joomla itself serves the downloads since November 2016.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Better support from importing from HTTPS sites</strong>.
