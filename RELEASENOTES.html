<h3>Release highlights</h3>
<p>
    <strong>New theme</strong>. Kickstart was long overdue for a new lick of paint. We changed our previous theme to a more flat design with the same color scheme we use in all of our other software.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Dark Mode</strong>. Embrace the dark side! When your browser is signalling that you're using a dark theme on a compatible operating system (macOS, Windows 10, Linux / GTK3, iOS, Android) Kickstart will automatically change its theme to vibrant color on a dark background. If you're a night own like us your eyes will thank you for the switch.
