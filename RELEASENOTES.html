<h3>Release highlights</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Kickstart CLI Mode</strong>. You can now call kickstart.php from the command line to extract backup
    archives anywhere. Please note that restoring the site still requires visiting the installation URL manually.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bust opcode caches before including feature and configuration files.</strong>. Fixes issues with Zend
    OPcache, APC, XCache etc. Do note that if you replace kickstart.php with a new version you still need to
    manually reset the opcode cache to let Kickstart run correctly (that's how opcode caches are supposed to work).
</p>

<h3>PHP 5.3.04+ is required</h3>
<p>
    Akeeba Kickstart requires PHP 5.3.04+, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 or 7.0. It won't run on hosts running PHP 5.3.03 (usually
    written as 5.3.3) or earlier, including PHP 5.2, 5.1, 5.0 and all 4.x versions.
